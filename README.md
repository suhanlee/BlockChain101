What is Blockchain: Explained for Beginners : https://medium.com/blockchain-education-network/what-is-blockchain-explained-for-beginners-5e747cea271

 Blockchain is a public record of transactions. 
 It’s also distributed, so instead of one person controlling everything, 
 there are thousands of computers around the world connected to a network, 
 and these thousands of computers together come to an agreement on which transactions are valid.
